        <h2>Coding: the top 5 things I care about as a newbie.</h2>

        <p> <em>I have just started my journey to become a front-end developer: here the five
            things I care about as a newbie. Which one will be the same in a few months? </em> 
        </p>
        
        <dl>
           <dt> <b>The more users, the better</b></dt>
           <dd>I would like to build interfaces that people find easy to navigate 
               without spending brain cells in finding “that” element (info, picture, button)
               they are looking for. Websites for everyone despite their social class, 
               digital literacy, lack of time.
             </dd> <br>

            <dt><b>Sharing knowledge is caring</b></dt>
            <dd>Sharing knowledge and resources for free or donation allows 
                more people as possible to get information and support: as a user, 
                as a early professional and as a senior. </dd> <br>
            
            <dt><b>Solving problems as fast and accurate as I can</b></dt>
            <dd> I have always had fun in finding solutions for smalls and big problems: 
                what I really like about this process is that – like in  research –
                you can always improve your work in making it smarter, faster, more accurate.
                A challenge that keeps your adrenaline high and your knowledge up to date.
            </dd> <br>

            <dt><b>Code from where I want, when I want</b></dt>
            <dd>Even if remote working and flexibility might bring to some scam effects 
                (read <a href=https://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/scam-of-century-unlimited-paid-vacation.html target="_blank">
                this article</a> about the illusion of unlimited paid vacation), I still think that coding 
                from where I want and when I want, respecting deadlines and job requirements 
                is not just utopic but a possibility for IT professionals.
            </dd> <br>

            <dt><b>Code is the new “lingua franca”</b></dt>
            <dd>Coding is achievieng what Latin tried, Esperanto failed miserably and English did it
                and partially succeed to: becoming the real world language. 
                Yes true, there are many programming languages and many ways to code but still:
                being accessible to really everyone makes it becoming the “lingua franca” 
                of the contemporary future.
